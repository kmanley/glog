glog
====

This is a minor (but useful) tweak to the standard 
glog package in https://github.com/golang/glog.

1. This version does not use the default CommandLine FlagSet. Instead you
must create a FlagSet and pass it to glog.Setup. This makes glog play nice
with other packages that use flags. 

2. This version only defaults to writing files to /tmp if --log_dir is
empty.
